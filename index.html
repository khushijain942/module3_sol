                    <h5 class="text-center">Dosa</h5>
                    <p>It is a delicious south-indian dish. I like it very much.
                        It is usually served with nariyal and imli chatni. You should definitely try it.<br>
                        A dosa is a rice pancake, originating from South India, made from a fermented batter.
                        It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance. Its main ingredients are rice and black gram,
                        ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt.
                        Dosas are a typical part of diets throughout South India street foodie official,
                        but the dish is now popular all over the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally,
                        dosas are served hot along with sambar and chutney. They can be consumed with idli podi as well.
                        <br>A mixture of rice and black gram that has been soaked in water is ground finely to form
                        a batter. Some add a handful of soaked fenugreek seeds. The proportion of rice to lentils
                        is generally 3:1 or 4:1. The batter is allowed to ferment overnight, before being mixed with
                        water to get the desired consistency. The batter is then ladled onto a hot tava (griddle)
                        greased with oil or ghee (clarified butter). It is spread out with the base of a ladle or
                        bowl to form a pancake. It can be made either to be thick like a pancake, or thin and crispy.
                        A dosa is served hot, either folded in half or rolled like a wrap. It is usually served
                        with chutney and sambar. The mixture of black grams and rice can be replaced with highly
                        refined wheat flour or semolina.</p>

                    <p>It is a simple yet delicious south-indian dish. It is easy to cook.
                        It takes less time to cook. I like it very much. Anyone can cook it easily
                        in their own way.<br>Uthappam is a type of dosa from South India.
                        Unlike a typical dosa, which is crisp and crepe-like, uttapam is thicker, with toppings.
                        <br>Uttapam batter is made of a 1:3 ratio of vigna mungo and rice; Rice can be a combination of
                        parboiled rice and a regular variety such as basmati.[1] The lentils and rice are soaked
                        overnight, ground and fermented until it rises. The batter is spread on a hot pan, generally
                        circular, toppings spread on it and patted gently. Oil is dripped around it, flipped when
                        it is golden-brown, oil dripped again, another flip to make sure the second surface is
                        baked too. The Uttapam is then ready to be served and eaten.</p>

                    <p>It is also a delicious south-indian dish. Its damn simple but the vessel required to cook
                        and its recepie both seems complicated. It can also be served with peanut chutni.
                        Its tastyyyyy and i like it alot.<br>To make Idli, four parts uncooked rice
                        (Idli rice or parboiled rice) to one part whole white lentil (black gram, Vigna mungo) are
                        soaked separately for at least four hours to six hours or overnight. Optionally spices such
                        as fenugreek seeds can be added at the time of soaking for additional flavour. Once done
                        soaking, the lentils are ground to a fine paste and the rice is separately coarsely ground,
                        then they are combined. Next, the mixture is left to ferment overnight during which its
                        volume will more than double. After fermentation some of the batter may be kept as a
                        starter culture for the next batch. The finished idli batter is put into greased moulds
                        of an idli tray or "tree" for steaming. The perforated molds allow the idlis to be
                        cooked evenly. The tree holds the trays above the level of boiling water in a pot,
                        and the pot is covered until the idlis are done (about 10â€“25 minutes, depending on size).
                        A more traditional method is to use leaves instead of moulds.</p>
